## About Me
I have an economics degree, but I have never worked in my specialty. I have experience in sales, worked as a department head. At the age of 31, I realized that I wanted to change my field of activity. The IT field has attracted me for a long time and I have always wanted to master a technical specialty. The choice fell on the profession of Frontend developer. The purpose of studying at School is to gain knowledge and skills that will help me successfully find a job in a new specialty after completing the course.
